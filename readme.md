-FORM VALIDATION:

. Ensures that all the fields are filled out before allowing the form to be submitted. 

. These fields are name, email, phone and message, all conected by theie ID.

. Validation using addEventListener. When the form is submitted, the function will be excecuted.

. "Trim" to remove white spaces and

. Creation of a specific alert if user is named IRONHACK. 

. Every label marked as "required" to force the user to  complete each section. If a value is empty, the user is alerted. 




- BACK END DATA


. Code fetches JSON data from an URL through an async function (named in this case firstContentJson)

. Try/catch to handle potential errors that might occur during the exectution of the code.

. Once we obtain the correct data, it updates HTML elements from the JSON documents (through innerHTML and setAttribute) to the webpage through the corresponding id and position (in this case all are fourth elements [3]in json)

 

-  RESPONSIVE FOR IPHONE SE 

.  The website was designed to work for a max-width screen of 480px

. The navigation bar and footer, get smaller according to the size of the new screen, while some elements from the body dissapear to generate a better interaction with the user.

. On the same line, the form is adjusted to fit the new screen as well as the margins and some font-sizes that are reduced for the same benefit.


- BACKLOG

. When bringing data form json, would have brought the second part of the document instead of writing it manually. 
. Creating alerts that specify in colour what is missing
. Taking extra time in the responsiveness of the site, looking into details of margins, paddings, sizes, etc.
. Adding a burguer menu to improve the interaction and the design of the site. 
. Making all in all, the site more responsive through the addition of more media queries.
